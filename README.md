Some people today are overwhelmed by choices, or become indecisive when presented with a variety of choices to eat.
Because we have to eat everyday, at some point, we have tried all the restaurants in our comfort zone, and you stop trying new places. 
So, in this project, we decided to make a Random Restaurant Generator website to solve the problem of not being able to decide where to eat or what to eat. 
We are implementing this through two ways, one will be through inputting the zipcode of the location the user wanted to eat at,
and the other one will be through just entering their own choices that they could think of or have thought of and it will be randomly generated. 
Therefore, it will solve the problem of not being able to decide. 

We used Yelp-API-Fusion to help us connect the zipcode with all the restaurants within the zipcode which will show their price range, rating, and etc. 

To build this website, we use Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS.
